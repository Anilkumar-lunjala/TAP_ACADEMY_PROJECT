        <h1>What is a Full Stack Developer?</h1>
        <pre>hexanovate    May 28, 2023    10:45 PM</pre>
        <p>A software engineer that is proficient in both front-end and back-end programming is known as a full-stack developer. 
            They have experience dealing with a variety of web development technologies, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, databases, 
            servers, APIs, and frameworks, among others.</p>
        <p>Let’s take the building of a Facebook-like social media platform as an example. The front-end and back-end of the 
            application would be built by a full-stack developer focusing on this project.</p>
        <p>In order to generate the platform’s visual elements, the developer would design the user interface on the front end 
            using tools like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, they would leverage front-end frameworks like React or 
            Angular to speed up the development process.</p>
        <p>In order to manage the data and process requests, the developer would write the server-side code using tools like 
            Node.js and PHP. To store user data and other data, they would also employ databases like MySQL or MongoDB.</p>
        <p>The integration of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) for functions like authentication, messaging, and 
            notifications would also fall within the purview of a complete stack developer.</p>
        <p>The full-stack developer may make sure that all parts are flawlessly linked and work together as an integrated unit 
            by working on both the front-end and back-end of the social media platform. Because of the wide breadth of technical 
            knowledge and problem-solving skills required, full-stack developers are in high demand in the software development sector.</p>
